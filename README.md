#London Tube
Given a list of London Tube stations and lines, write an application to answer the following question:  What stations are N stops from East Ham?  For stations with multiple routes include the station only if the minimum number of stops = N.  Print out the results in alphabetical order.
For example, if N = 5, the complete answer would be:

•	Bow Road

•	Dagenham East

•	East India

•	Hackney Wick

•	Leyton

•	Leyton Midland Road

•	Mile End

•	North Greenwich

•	Pudding Mill Lane

•	Royal Victoria

•	Stratford High Street

•	Stratford International

•	West Silvertown

For example, Canning Town from East Ham is possible with 4 or 5 stops, but we only consider it a valid answer for 4 stops, not 5, since we only consider the minimum number of stops.
You may use any language and tools to write your application but please use GitHub.com to store your code.
